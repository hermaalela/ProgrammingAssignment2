# Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit
# to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly. The
# following two functions are used to cache the inverse of a matrix.

# makeCacheMatrix creates a list containing a function to
# 1. set the value of the matrix
# 2. get the value of the matrix
# 3. set the value of inverse of the matrix


makeCacheMatrix <- function(x) {
        ##  The function cacheSolve returns the inverse of the matrix created with
        ##  the makeCacheMatrix function.
        ##        
        ##  if the cached inverse is available, cacheSolve retrieves it, and if
        ##        
        ##  not, it computes, caches, and returns it. thats the gist of this.

# The following function returns the inverse of the matrix. It first checks if
# the inverse has already been computed. If so, it gets the result and skips the
# computation. If not, it computes the inverse, sets the value in the cache via
# setinverse function.

# This function assumes that the matrix is always invertible.

        ## Return a matrix that is the inv_merse of 'x'
